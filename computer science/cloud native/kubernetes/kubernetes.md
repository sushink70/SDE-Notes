## 1. Introduction & Core Concepts

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

### Why Kubernetes?

**Cloud-Native Benefits:**
- **Portability**: Run anywhere (on-premises, public cloud, hybrid)
- **Scalability**: Automatic horizontal and vertical scaling
- **High Availability**: Self-healing and fault tolerance
- **Declarative Configuration**: Desired state management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization
- **Microservices Support**: Native support for distributed architectures

### Core Concepts

**Cluster**: A set of nodes that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.

**Node**: A worker machine (VM or physical) that runs containerized applications. Each node is managed by the control plane.

**Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A pod encapsulates one or more containers, storage resources, a unique network IP, and options for how containers should run.

**Container**: Lightweight, standalone executable packages that include everything needed to run software.

## 2. Architecture & Components

### Control Plane Components

**API Server (kube-apiserver)**
- Front-end for the Kubernetes control plane
- Exposes the Kubernetes API
- All communication goes through the API server
- **Security**: Entry point for all cluster operations; must be properly secured with authentication and authorization

**etcd**
- Distributed key-value store
- Stores all cluster data and state
- **Security Critical**: Contains all secrets, configurations, and cluster state
- Must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular backups are essential

**Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**
- Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node
- Selects a node for them to run on based on resource requirements, constraints, affinity specifications, and available resources
- **Cloud-Native**: Considers multi-zone/region placement for high availability

**Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**
- Runs controller processes
- Node Controller: Monitors node health
- Replication Controller: Maintains correct number of pods
- Endpoints Controller: Populates endpoint objects
- Service Account & Token Controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens

**Cloud Controller Manager**
- Integrates with underlying cloud provider APIs
- Manages cloud-specific resources (load balancers, storage volumes, networking)
- **Cloud-Native**: Enables portable workloads across different cloud providers

### Node Components

**kubelet**
- Agent running on each node
- Ensures containers are running in pods
- Communicates with the API server
- **Security**: Authenticate using TLS certificates

**kube-proxy**
- Network proxy running on each node
- Maintains network rules for pod communication
- Implements part of the Service concept

**Container Runtime**
- Software responsible for running containers
- Supports CRI (Container Runtime Interface)
- Examples: containerd, CRI-O, Docker Engine

---

## 3. Workload Resources

### Pods

Pods are the fundamental building blocks. They represent a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

**Pod Lifecycle Phases:**
- Pending: Accepted but not yet running
- Running: Bound to a node and all containers created
- Succeeded: All containers terminated successfully
- Failed: All containers terminated, at least one failed
- Unknown: State cannot be obtained

**Security Considerations:**
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use read-only root filesystems
- Drop unnecessary capabilities
- Use Pod Security Standards

### ReplicaSets

Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at any time. Usually managed by Deployments.

### Deployments

Declarative way to manage ReplicaSets and Pods. Provides:
- Rolling updates and rollbacks
- Scaling
- Self-healing
- Version control

**Cloud-Native Pattern**: Enables zero-downtime deployments and easy rollback mechanisms.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsNonRoot: true
        runAsUser: 1000
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.21
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
          capabilities:
            drop:
            - ALL
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### StatefulSets

For stateful applications requiring:
- Stable network identities
- Persistent storage
- Ordered deployment and scaling
- Examples: Databases, messaging queues

**Security**: Requires careful management of persistent volumes and access controls.

### DaemonSets

Ensures all (or selected) nodes run a copy of a Pod. Use cases:
- Log collectors
- Monitoring agents
- Node-level services

### Jobs and CronJobs

**Jobs**: Run pods to completion (batch processing)
**CronJobs**: Run jobs on a schedule (periodic tasks)

---

## 4. Networking

### Kubernetes Network Model

**Principles:**
- Every pod gets its own IP address
- Pods can communicate with all other pods without NAT
- Agents on a node can communicate with all pods on that node

### Services

Abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and access policy.

**Service Types:**

**ClusterIP (default)**
- Internal cluster communication only
- Most secure option for internal services

**NodePort**
- Exposes service on each node's IP at a static port
- Accessible from outside cluster
- **Security Risk**: Exposes ports on all nodes

**LoadBalancer**
- Cloud provider external load balancer
- **Cloud-Native**: Integrates with cloud provider's load balancing service
- Automatic external IP assignment

**ExternalName**
- Maps service to a DNS name

### Ingress

Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services. Provides:
- Load balancing
- SSL/TLS termination
- Name-based virtual hosting
- Path-based routing

**Security Features:**
- TLS/SSL certificate management
- Authentication integration
- Rate limiting
- WAF integration

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: secure-ingress
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myapp.example.com
    secretName: myapp-tls
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: myapp-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Network Policies

Firewall rules for pod-to-pod communication.

**Security**: Essential for implementing zero-trust networking and microsegmentation.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

### Service Mesh

Advanced networking layer (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) providing:
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) between services
- Traffic management
- Observability
- Security policies

**Cloud-Native**: Essential for complex microservices architectures.

---

## 5. Storage

### Volumes

Different types for various use cases:

**emptyDir**: Temporary storage, deleted when pod is removed
**hostPath**: Mounts directory from host (security risk, avoid in production)
**persistentVolumeClaim**: Request for storage by a pod

### Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

**PV**: Cluster-level storage resource
**PVC**: Request for storage by a user

**Storage Classes**: Dynamic provisioning of storage based on policies.

**Cloud-Native**: Cloud providers offer dynamic provisioning through CSI drivers.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: app-data
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast-ssd
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
```

**Security Considerations:**
- Encrypt data at rest
- Use appropriate access modes (ReadWriteOnce, ReadOnlyMany, ReadWriteMany)
- Implement backup strategies
- Use CSI drivers with security features

### Container Storage Interface (CSI)

Standard interface for storage systems. Benefits:
- Vendor-neutral
- Out-of-tree plugins
- Advanced features (snapshots, cloning, expansion)

---

## 6. Configuration & Secrets Management

### ConfigMaps

Store non-confidential configuration data in key-value pairs.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  database_url: "postgres://db.example.com:5432"
  log_level: "info"
  feature_flags: |
    feature_a=enabled
    feature_b=disabled
```

### Secrets

Store sensitive information (passwords, tokens, SSH keys).

**Security Critical:**
- Base64 encoded (NOT encrypted by default)
- Must enable encryption at rest in etcd
- Use external secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Limit access using RBAC

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-credentials
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # base64 encoded
  password: cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```

**Best Practice**: Use external secrets operators:
- External Secrets Operator
- Sealed Secrets
- HashiCorp Vault integration

### Environment Variables vs Volume Mounts

**Environment Variables**: Simple, suitable for non-file data
**Volume Mounts**: Better for files, automatic updates when ConfigMap/Secret changes

---

## 7. Security (In-Depth)

### Authentication

Methods to verify user/service identity:

**X.509 Client Certificates**: PKI-based authentication
**Static Token Files**: Deprecated, insecure
**Bootstrap Tokens**: For node joining
**Service Account Tokens**: For pods to authenticate to API server
**OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Integration with identity providers
**Webhook Token Authentication**: Custom authentication

**Cloud-Native**: Integrate with cloud IAM (AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM)

### Authorization

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

**Core Resources:**
- **Role**: Namespace-scoped permissions
- **ClusterRole**: Cluster-wide permissions
- **RoleBinding**: Grants Role permissions to users
- **ClusterRoleBinding**: Grants ClusterRole permissions

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: production
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: production
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

**Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions.

### Pod Security

**Pod Security Standards (PSS)**: Three levels
- **Privileged**: Unrestricted (development only)
- **Baseline**: Minimally restrictive, prevents known privilege escalations
- **Restricted**: Heavily restricted, following current pod hardening best practices

**Pod Security Admission**: Enforces Pod Security Standards at namespace level.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: production
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: restricted
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: restricted
```

**Security Context**: Define privileges and access control settings

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 1000
  fsGroup: 2000
  seccompProfile:
    type: RuntimeDefault
  capabilities:
    drop:
    - ALL
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### Network Security

**Network Policies**: Implement microsegmentation
- Default deny all traffic
- Explicitly allow required communication paths
- Separate ingress and egress rules

**Service Mesh Security**:
- Automatic mTLS between services
- Certificate management
- Traffic encryption

### Image Security

**Best Practices:**
- Use trusted registries
- Scan images for vulnerabilities (Trivy, Clair, Aqua)
- Sign images (Cosign, Notary)
- Use minimal base images (distroless, Alpine)
- Don't store secrets in images
- Use specific image tags, not `latest`
- Implement image pull policies

**Admission Controllers**:
- ImagePolicyWebhook: Validate images before deployment
- Policy engines (OPA Gatekeeper, Kyverno)

### Secrets Management

**External Secrets Management:**
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- GCP Secret Manager

**Sealed Secrets**: Encrypt secrets in Git repositories

**Rotation**: Implement automatic secret rotation

### Audit Logging

Enable audit logs to track:
- API requests
- Authentication attempts
- Authorization decisions
- Resource modifications

```yaml
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
- level: Metadata
  resources:
  - group: ""
    resources: ["secrets", "configmaps"]
- level: RequestResponse
  verbs: ["create", "update", "delete"]
```

### Security Scanning & Compliance

**Tools:**
- kube-bench: CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
- kube-hunter: Penetration testing
- Falco: Runtime security
- Kubescape: Security posture management

**Cloud-Native Security**: Shift-left approach, security integrated into CI/CD pipeline.

## 8. Cloud-Native Principles & Practices

### The Twelve-Factor App

1. **Codebase**: One codebase in version control, many deploys
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare dependencies
3. **Config**: Store config in environment
4. **Backing Services**: Treat as attached resources
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Strict separation
6. **Processes**: Execute as stateless processes
7. **Port Binding**: Export services via port binding
8. **Concurrency**: Scale out via process model
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup and graceful shutdown
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep environments similar
11. **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams
12. **Admin Processes**: Run as one-off processes

### Microservices Architecture

**Benefits:**
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation
- Scalability

**Kubernetes Support:**

- Load balancing
- Configuration management
- Health checks

### Design Patterns

**Sidecar Pattern**: Helper container alongside main container
- Examples: Log shippers, proxies, monitoring agents

**Ambassador Pattern**: Proxy for external services

**Adapter Pattern**: Standardize output from containers

**Init Containers**: Run before main containers, perform setup tasks

### Health Checks

**Liveness Probe**: Determines if container is running
**Readiness Probe**: Determines if container can serve traffic
**Startup Probe**: For slow-starting containers

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 15
  periodSeconds: 10
  timeoutSeconds: 5
  failureThreshold: 3
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

### Resource Management

**Requests**: Guaranteed resources (used for scheduling)
**Limits**: Maximum resources allowed

**Quality of Service (QoS) Classes:**
- **Guaranteed**: Requests = Limits for all containers
- **Burstable**: At least one container has request or limit
- **BestEffort**: No requests or limits set

**Cloud-Native**: Efficient resource utilization reduces costs.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Automatically scale based on metrics:
- CPU utilization
- Memory utilization
- Custom metrics
- External metrics

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
```

### Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)

Automatically adjusts CPU and memory requests/limits.
