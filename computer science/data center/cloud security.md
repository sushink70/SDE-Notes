# Comprehensive Guide to Cloud Security

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Security

Cloud security encompasses the policies, technologies, controls, and services that protect cloud data, applications, and infrastructure from threats. As organizations migrate to cloud environments, understanding security becomes critical to protect assets while maintaining compliance and business continuity.

### Cloud Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provider manages physical infrastructure; you manage OS, applications, data
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provider manages infrastructure and platform; you manage applications and data
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Provider manages everything; you manage user access and data usage

### Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure for single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple cloud providers

## 2. Shared Responsibility Model

Understanding who is responsible for what is fundamental to cloud security.

### Provider Responsibilities

- Physical security of data centers
- Network infrastructure security
- Hypervisor and virtualization layer
- Hardware maintenance and updates

### Customer Responsibilities

- Data encryption and classification
- Identity and access management
- Application security
- Network traffic protection
- Operating system patches and updates
- Endpoint protection

The division varies by service model—more responsibility falls on customers in IaaS versus SaaS.

## 3. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### Core Principles

**Least Privilege**: Users receive minimum permissions needed for their role.

**Zero Trust**: "Never trust, always verify"—authenticate and authorize every access request regardless of location.

**Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls.

### Key Components

**Authentication**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Single Sign-On (SSO)
- Passwordless authentication (biometrics, security keys)
- Certificate-based authentication

**Authorization**

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)
- Just-in-Time (JIT) access

**Identity Federation**

- SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect

### Best Practices

- Implement strong password policies
- Enforce MFA for all users
- Regular access reviews and audits
