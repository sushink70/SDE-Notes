As a software engineer, you do not need to “learn every methodology.” Instead, you should be fluent in the **small set that most engineering teams actually use** and understand how to work effectively within them. Below is a pragmatic, career-focused recommendation.

---

# ✅ **Must Learn & Adopt (High Priority)**

## 1️⃣ Scrum (Non-negotiable)

This is the default Agile operating model in most development teams worldwide.

You should be fully comfortable with:

* Sprints
* Sprint Planning
* Daily Standups
* Sprint Review / Demo
* Retrospective
* Story Points & Velocity
* Product Backlog / Sprint Backlog
* Working with Product Owners & Scrum Masters

**Why learn:**
Most product teams hire under “Scrum environment” expectations. Interviewers expect you to speak fluently about delivering in Sprints, handling changing requirements, collaborating in ceremonies, and incremental delivery.

---

## 2️⃣ Kanban (Almost as important)

Extremely common in:

* Backend/platform
* DevOps
* Maintenance/support
* Continuous delivery teams

You should know:

* Visualizing work in boards
* WIP limits
* Pull-based work scheduling
* Flow efficiency
* Cycle time vs lead time

**Why learn:**
Kanban is everywhere in real engineering teams, especially outside formal product Scrum teams.

---

## 3️⃣ DevOps + Agile Way of Working (Essential Modern Skill)

Companies now expect engineers to deliver continuously, not only “write code”.

You should understand:

* CI / CD pipelines
* Trunk-based or short-lived branch development
* Continuous testing mindset
* Deployment frequency
* Monitoring & incident handling mindset
* Collaboration between Dev + Ops

**Why learn:**
“Agile without DevOps” is outdated. Teams value engineers who can deliver, not just code.

---

# ⚠️ **Good to Know (Career Advantage)**

## 4️⃣ Scrumban

Most real-world teams evolve into this hybrid naturally.
Understanding it helps when teams unofficially mix Scrum + Kanban.

---

## 5️⃣ SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

Relevant for:

* Large enterprises
* Banking / Telecom / Government / Fortune 500
* Multi-team environments

You only need **awareness** unless you’re targeting enterprise environments:

* PI Planning
* Agile Release Trains
* Program Increment execution

---

## 6️⃣ Lean / Product Thinking

This is becoming highly valued:

* Customer value > feature output
* Hypothesis-driven development
* Continuous improvement mindset

Helps you stand out as **not just a coder, but a product engineer**.

---

# ❌ **Not Necessary Unless Required**

You do NOT need to deeply learn unless your job demands:

* Crystal
* DSDM
* FDD
* RUP
* PRINCE2 Agile
* Nexus / LeSS / Scrum@Scale
* Waterfall / V-Model / Spiral (except basic awareness)

These are niche or management-oriented.

---

# 🎯 **Practical Roadmap**

If you want a clean path:

1️⃣ Master Scrum deeply
2️⃣ Be comfortable working in Kanban
3️⃣ Apply DevOps + Continuous Delivery mindset daily
4️⃣ Learn SAFe concepts if entering large enterprise
5️⃣ Develop product thinking + collaboration mindset

---

# 🧠 **How to Present This in Interviews**

Be able to clearly articulate:

* how you worked in Sprints
* how you estimate and plan work
* how you collaborate in standups/reviews
* how you handle changing requirements
* how CI/CD supports Agile delivery
* how Kanban improves flow

That is what companies expect in reality.

---

If you tell me:

* your experience level (student / junior / mid / senior)
* region (India / US / EU / etc.)
* target companies (startup / MNC / product / service)

I can tailor this to exactly what **you should learn next step-by-step**.


If you mean **what delivery methodologies and frameworks most companies expect or commonly use today**, the market trend is very clear. Across hiring, governance, and delivery practice, organizations typically look for the following:

---

# What Most Companies Ask For Today

## 1️⃣ Scrum (by a wide margin)

* Most common Agile framework in job descriptions.
* “Sprint-based delivery” is the default expectation.
* Product Owner / Scrum Master roles are widely recognized.
* Stakeholders, HR, and leadership understand it well.
* Common certifications requested:

  * CSM / PSM (Scrum Master)
  * PSPO / CSPO (Product Owner)

**Reality:**
Even companies that say “Agile” usually mean “Scrum”.

---

## 2️⃣ Kanban

* Very common in:

  * Support / Maintenance teams
  * DevOps / Platform / Infra teams
  * Continuous delivery environments
* Popular because:

  * Easier adoption.
  * Works without strict sprint commitments.
  * Highly visual, flow-based, reduces bottlenecks.

---

## 3️⃣ Hybrid Agile (Scrum + Kanban = Scrumban)

* Used where Scrum is “too rigid” but Kanban feels “too loose”.
* Common in real-world product teams.
* Often not advertised explicitly; teams simply operate this way.

---

## 4️⃣ Scaling Frameworks (Enterprise)

Large organizations rarely run a single Scrum team; they run dozens or hundreds. For this reason, most enterprises ask for:

### SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)

* Most widely adopted enterprise Agile scaling framework.
* Common in Fortune 100/500, banking, insurance, telecom, government, and regulated industries.
* Frequently seen in job posts:

  * “Experience working in SAFe environment”
  * “PI Planning”
  * “ARTs / Release Train Engineer experience”

### LeSS / Nexus / Scrum@Scale

* Less common than SAFe but increasingly recognized
* Preferred in tech-first companies and product-centric organizations.

---

## 5️⃣ DevOps + Agile (Very Strong Market Demand)

Companies expect Agile to be complemented with delivery practice.

Common expectations:

* CI/CD
* Continuous Delivery mindset
* Automation awareness
* Collaboration between Dev + Ops
* SRE culture in more advanced companies

Job descriptions often say:

* “Agile + DevOps culture”
* “Experience delivering in Agile DevOps environment”

---

## 6️⃣ Lean / Product Mindset Growth

Modern companies are shifting from:

* “Deliver features”
  to
* “Deliver outcomes”

So employers increasingly value:

* Lean thinking
* Product Discovery
* Dual-track Agile
* Customer value focus
* UX & experimentation alignment

---

## 7️⃣ Regions & Industry Variations

### USA / Europe

* Scrum dominates.
* SAFe common in enterprises.
* DevOps culture strong.

### UK Government / Europe Regulated Environments

* PRINCE2 Agile + Scrum + SAFe common.

### India & APAC Corporate

* Heavy Scrum usage.
* Rapidly increasing SAFe adoption.
* Many teams say “Agile” but run modified Waterfall internally; however hiring still demands Agile terminology.

---
