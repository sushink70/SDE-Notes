Based on recent research, several cloud certifications and courses with free certificates of completion or badges are available in 2026. These are entirely free (no exam fees or course costs), focusing on major providers like AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Oracle, and IBM, as well as related fields such as security, AI, and monitoring. I've prioritized those recognized by employers for building foundational skills, career entry, or specialization, often leading to paid advanced certifications or job opportunities. Note that "certifications" here include vendor badges, digital credentials, or completion certificates that hold value in resumes and LinkedIn profiles. Vendor exams for full professional certs (e.g., AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner) typically cost money, but the prep and foundational badges listed are free.

Finding high-value cloud certifications that are **100% free (including the exam)** is rare because proctored exams typically cost $100–$300. However, in late 2025 and 2026, there are a few "Gold Standard" opportunities where the exam fee is waived, as well as several "Silver Standard" options (free training + recognized digital badges).

Here are the latest and most valuable free cloud certification opportunities.

### 🏆 Tier 1: "Gold Standard" (Free Exam + Certificate)

*These are full professional certifications where the exam fee is currently waived or sponsored.*

#### 1. ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) - **Best for Security**

This is arguably the most valuable free certification available right now. ISC2 (the makers of the gold-standard CISSP) has a "One Million Certified in Cybersecurity" pledge.

* **What it is:** An entry-level security certification covering security principles, business continuity, disaster recovery, and network security.
* **Value:** ISC2 is a globally respected body. This is a full, proctored professional certification, not just a completion badge.
* **Cost:** **$0** (Training is free + Exam fee is waived). *Note: You may need to pay a $50 annual member fee (AMF) only **after** you pass to claim the badge, but the exam itself is free.*
* **How to get it:**
1. Go to the [ISC2 1MCC Landing Page](https://www.isc2.org/landing/1mcc).
2. Create an account and fill out the application.
3. Select "Certified in Cybersecurity" as your interest.
4. You will receive a free exam voucher code to schedule your test at a Pearson VUE center or online.



#### 2. Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenges - **Best for Azure & AI**

Microsoft does not make exams free year-round, but they run predictable "Challenges" 2-3 times a year where completing a learning path earns you a **50% or 100% off exam voucher**.

* **Value:** Official Microsoft certifications (like AZ-900 or AI-900) are industry standards for Azure.
* **Upcoming Opportunities (2026):**
* **Microsoft Spring Skills Challenge:** usually runs March–April.
* **Microsoft Build:** usually runs in May.


* **Strategy:** Do not pay for a Microsoft exam yet. Search for "Microsoft Cloud Skills Challenge" in March 2026. If you complete the designated modules (approx. 10-20 hours of reading), they email you a voucher.

#### 3. Alibaba Cloud Associates (New User Path) - **Best for Multi-Cloud Resume**

Alibaba Cloud is huge in Asia and growing globally. They often have a "New User" promotion.

* **What it is:** The **ACA (Alibaba Cloud Associate)** certification.
* **Value:** Demonstrates you can work with cloud providers outside the "Big Three" (AWS/Azure/GCP).
* **How to get it:**
1. Visit the **Alibaba Cloud Academy**.
2. Look for the "New User Learning Path."
3. Typically, if you complete their free "Clouder" courses and pass a few mini-quizzes, you unlock a free voucher for the full ACA Cloud Computing Associate exam.



---

### 🥈 Tier 2: "Silver Standard" (Free Training + Digital Badges)

*These don't offer a proctored "Certification" title, but they provide a verified Digital Badge (for LinkedIn) from the vendor, which is valuable for demonstrating skills.*

#### 1. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Training & Badges

*Status Update 2025/2026:* Oracle previously offered free exams for their "Foundations Associate." As of late 2025, they have shifted some exams to paid ($95). **However**, they often release **free "AI Foundations"** courses with badges to promote their AI services.

* **Action:** Check the **Oracle University** website for "AI Foundations" or "GenAI Professional." These specific tracks are the most likely to be free to encourage adoption.

#### 2. Google Cloud Skills Boost (The Arcade)

Google runs a gamified learning platform called "The Arcade."

* **Value:** You earn "Skill Badges" (e.g., "Deploy to Kubernetes in Google Cloud") rather than a simple certificate of completion. These badges are verifiable by employers.
* **Cost:** Free (you usually get free credits to run the actual labs).
* **How to access:** Search for **"Google Cloud Skills Boost Arcade."** Subscribe to the updates to get free access codes for hands-on labs.

#### 3. IBM Cognitive Class (AI & Data Science)

IBM offers extensive free courses on their "Cognitive Class" platform.

* **Value:** You can earn badges in Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and Generative AI.
* **Notable Course:** **"Docker Essentials: A Developer Introduction"** or **"Python for Data Science."** The badges are issued through Credly (the same platform used by AWS/Microsoft), making them look professional on a resume.
