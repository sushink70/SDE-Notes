## Fundamentals and Definitions

## What is a Distributed System?

A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. The key characteristics include:

- **Multiple autonomous nodes**: Each computer operates independently
- **Network communication**: Nodes communicate via message passing
- **Shared state coordination**: Nodes work together toward common goals
- **Transparency**: Users see the system as a single entity
- **Fault tolerance**: System continues operating despite individual node failures

## Why Distributed Systems?

### Scalability Requirements
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add more machines rather than upgrading existing ones
- **Geographic distribution**: Serve users globally with low latency
- **Load distribution**: Spread work across multiple machines
- **Storage capacity**: Handle data volumes that exceed single machine limits

### Availability Requirements
- **No single point of failure**: System remains available despite individual failures
- **Graceful degradation**: Reduced functionality rather than complete outage
- **Disaster recovery**: Survive data center outages or natural disasters
- **Maintenance windows**: Update systems without downtime

### Performance Requirements
- **Parallel processing**: Execute tasks simultaneously on multiple machines
- **Reduced latency**: Place computation closer to users
- **Specialized hardware**: Use different machines for different workloads
- **Resource utilization**: Better utilization through resource sharing

## Types of Distributed Systems

### By Architecture Pattern
- **Client-Server**: Centralized servers serving multiple clients
- **Peer-to-Peer**: All nodes are equal participants
- **Service-Oriented**: Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Microservices**: Fine-grained services with independent deployment
- **Serverless**: Event-driven functions with automatic scaling

### By Coupling Level
- **Tightly Coupled**: Nodes have strong dependencies and synchronization
- **Loosely Coupled**: Nodes operate independently with minimal dependencies
- **Asynchronous**: Nodes communicate without waiting for responses
- **Event-Driven**: Nodes react to events from other nodes

### By Data Management
- **Shared Nothing**: Each node has its own data and processing
- **Shared Disk**: Nodes share storage but have separate processing
- **Shared Memory**: Nodes share both storage and processing resources

# Core Challenges

## The Eight Fallacies of Distributed Computing

1. **The network is reliable**: Networks fail, packets are lost, connections drop
2. **Latency is zero**: Network communication takes time and varies
3. **Bandwidth is infinite**: Network capacity is limited and shared
4. **The network is secure**: Networks can be compromised or eavesdropped
5. **Topology doesn't change**: Network structure evolves over time
6. **There is one administrator**: Multiple parties may control different parts
7. **Transport cost is zero**: Network communication has monetary and performance costs
8. **The network is homogeneous**: Different protocols, formats, and systems coexist

## Fundamental Problems

### Failure Detection
- **Challenge**: Distinguishing between slow nodes and failed nodes
- **Approaches**: Heartbeats, timeouts, failure detectors
- **Trade-offs**: False positives vs detection speed

### Partial Failures

# System Models and Assumptions

## Network Models

### Synchronous Model
- **Assumptions**: Bounded message delivery time, bounded processing time
- **Benefits**: Easier to reason about, deterministic timeouts
- **Reality**: Rarely achievable in practice due to network variability

### Asynchronous Model
- **Assumptions**: No bounds on message delivery or processing time
- **Benefits**: More realistic, robust to timing variations
- **Challenges**: Impossibility results (FLP theorem), harder coordination

### Partial Synchrony
- **Assumptions**: System alternates between synchronous and asynchronous periods
- **Reality**: Most real systems fall into this category
- **Implications**: Protocols must handle both modes

## Failure Models

### Crash Failures (Fail-Stop)
- **Behavior**: Node stops executing and doesn't restart
- **Detection**: Relatively easy through timeouts
- **Impact**: Loss of service but no corruption

### Omission Failures
- **Send Omission**: Node fails to send messages
- **Receive Omission**: Node fails to receive messages
- **Impact**: Appears as network partition or slow node

### Timing Failures
- **Behavior**: Node operates correctly but too slowly
- **Impact**: Timeouts, perceived failures, system instability
- **Mitigation**: Adaptive timeouts, back-pressure mechanisms

### Byzantine Failures (Arbitrary Failures)
- **Behavior**: Node exhibits arbitrary, potentially malicious behavior
- **Challenges**: Most difficult to handle, requires consensus protocols
- **Applications**: Critical systems, blockchain, security-sensitive applications

## Consistency Models

### Strong Consistency
- **Linearizability**: Operations appear to execute atomically at some point between start and completion
- **Sequential Consistency**: All nodes see operations in the same order
- **Benefits**: Easy to reason about, matches single-machine behavior
- **Costs**: Performance penalties, availability impact

### Weak Consistency
- **Eventual Consistency**: System will become consistent given enough time without updates
- **Causal Consistency**: Causally related operations are seen in the same order
- **Benefits**: Better performance and availability
- **Challenges**: Application complexity, potential conflicts

### Consistency Patterns
- **Read-Your-Writes**: Users see their own updates immediately
- **Monotonic Reads**: Users don't see older versions after seeing newer ones
- **Monotonic Writes**: User's writes are applied in the order issued
- **Writes-Follow-Reads**: Writes that depend on reads see those reads' effects

# Consistency Models

## CAP Theorem

### Statement
In a distributed system, you can have at most two of:
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data simultaneously
- **Availability**: System remains operational despite failures
- **Partition Tolerance**: System continues despite network partitions

### Practical Implications
- **CA Systems**: Traditional RDBMS (sacrifice partition tolerance)
- **CP Systems**: Strong consistency systems (sacrifice availability during partitions)
- **AP Systems**: High availability systems (sacrifice strong consistency)

### Beyond CAP: PACELC
- **PACELC**: If Partition, choose between Availability and Consistency; Else choose between Latency and Consistency
- **Insight**: Even without partitions, there are trade-offs between latency and consistency

## Consistency Levels in Practice

### Strong Consistency
- **Implementation**: Synchronous replication, consensus protocols
- **Examples**: Traditional databases, Zookeeper, etcd
- **Use Cases**: Financial systems, inventory management, user accounts

### Eventual Consistency

### Causal Consistency
- **Guarantee**: Causally related operations are ordered consistently
- **Implementation**: Vector clocks, dependency tracking
- **Use Cases**: Collaborative editing, message ordering, social networks

## Implementing Consistency

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
- **Phase 1**: Coordinator asks all participants to prepare
- **Phase 2**: Coordinator tells participants to commit or abort
- **Issues**: Blocking protocol, coordinator failure problems
- **Optimizations**: Presumed abort, presumed commit

### Three-Phase Commit (3PC)
- **Addition**: Non-blocking commit phase
- **Benefits**: Handles coordinator failures better
- **Costs**: Additional network round trip
- **Reality**: Rarely used due to complexity vs benefit

### Saga Pattern
- **Concept**: Long-running transactions as sequence of local transactions
- **Compensation**: Each step has a compensating action
- **Coordination**: Orchestration vs choreography approaches
- **Use Cases**: Microservices, business processes, workflows

# Consensus and Agreement

## The Consensus Problem

### Problem Statement
Multiple nodes must agree on a single value despite:
- Message loss and delays
- Node failures
- Network partitions
- Concurrent proposals

### Requirements
- **Agreement**: All non-faulty nodes decide on the same value
- **Validity**: Decided value must be proposed by some node
- **Termination**: All non-faulty nodes eventually decide

## FLP Impossibility Result

### Statement
No deterministic consensus protocol can guarantee termination in an asynchronous system with even one faulty node.

### Implications
- **Practical Reality**: Real systems use timeouts and assumptions
- **Randomization**: Randomized algorithms can achieve consensus
- **Partial Synchrony**: Eventual synchrony enables consensus

## Practical Consensus Algorithms

### Paxos
- **Roles**: Proposers, Acceptors, Learners
- **Phases**: Prepare phase, Accept phase
- **Properties**: Safety always, liveness under eventual synchrony
- **Challenges**: Complex to implement and understand

#### Basic Paxos Algorithm
1. **Prepare Phase**:
   - Proposer sends PREPARE(n) to majority of acceptors
   - Acceptors respond with promise not to accept proposals < n
   - If acceptor has accepted a value, it includes that value

2. **Accept Phase**:
   - If majority responds, proposer sends ACCEPT(n, v)
   - Acceptors accept if they haven't promised to ignore n
   - If majority accepts, value is chosen

#### Multi-Paxos
- **Optimization**: Skip prepare phase for sequential decisions
- **Leader Election**: Elect a stable leader to reduce conflicts
- **Log Replication**: Apply Paxos to replicate a sequence of operations

### Raft
- **Design Goal**: Understandability compared to Paxos
- **Leader Election**: Elect a single leader for term-based leadership
- **Log Replication**: Leader appends entries and replicates to followers
- **Safety**: Strong leader principle ensures safety

#### Raft Components
1. **Leader Election**:
   - Followers become candidates if they don't hear from leader
   - Candidates request votes from majority
   - Winner becomes leader for a term

2. **Log Replication**:
   - Leader accepts client requests and appends to log
   - Leader replicates entries to followers
   - Leader commits entries once majority has them

3. **Safety Properties**:
   - Election Safety: At most one leader per term
   - Leader Append-Only: Leader never overwrites log entries
   - Log Matching: Logs are identical up to any index
   - Leader Completeness: Committed entries appear in all future leaders
   - State Machine Safety: Applied entries are identical across nodes

### PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
