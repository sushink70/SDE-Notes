I'll guide you through reading Rust crate documentation and then analyze your digital signature system design.

## Reading Rust Crate Documentation

**1. Official Documentation Sources:**
- **docs.rs**: Primary source for all published crates (e.g., `docs.rs/axum`, `docs.rs/tokio-postgres`)
- **Crate's README**: Often has quick start guides and examples
- **GitHub repository**: Check examples/ directory and integration tests

**2. Navigation Strategy:**
- Start with the crate's main page for overview and feature flags
- Check "Examples" section first - most practical learning
- Read module-level docs before diving into specific functions
- Use the search functionality extensively

**3. Key Sections to Focus On:**
- **Feature flags**: Understanding optional dependencies
- **Error types**: Critical for proper error handling
- **Async considerations**: Especially important for your stack
- **Security notes**: Look for sections on secure usage

**4. Recommended Reading Order for Your Project:**
- `axum` - web framework basics, routing, middleware
- `tokio-postgres` - async database operations
- `argon2` or `bcrypt` - password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT handling
- `lettre` - email sending
- `uuid` - unique identifier generation

## System Design Analysis

**Strengths in Your Design:**
- Immutable digital signatures (good for integrity)
- Centralized verification system
- Email-based recovery mechanisms
- 2FA consideration

**Critical Security Vulnerabilities & Design Flaws:**

**1. Digital Signature Concept Confusion:**
Your system seems to conflate "digital signature" with "digital identity certificate." True digital signatures are cryptographic proofs created by private keys, not stored hashes. Consider if you mean:
- Digital certificates/identity tokens
- Cryptographic signatures of documents
- Unique user identifiers

**2. Government ID Storage:**
- **Major Risk**: Storing fingerprints, passport numbers, Aadhaar violates privacy laws
- **Recommendation**: Use zero-knowledge proofs or hash-and-salt these identifiers
- **Compliance**: Check GDPR, local data protection laws

**3. Hash Collision Prevention Flaw:**
- Simple hash checking won't prevent determined collision attacks
- **Better approach**: Use cryptographically secure UUIDs + timestamps + user context

**4. Single Point of Failure:**
- Centralized server creates vulnerability
- Consider distributed verification or blockchain-based approach

**5. Account Recovery Paradox:**
- If signatures are immutable but accounts can be recovered, this creates an attack vector
- Malicious actors could potentially recover accounts and misuse existing signatures

**6. Database Security Gaps:**
- No mention of encryption at rest
- No database access controls specified
- Consider column-level encryption for sensitive data

**Recommended Security Enhancements:**

**Authentication Layer:**
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Use secure session management
- Add CAPTCHA for sensitive operations

**Data Protection:**
- Encrypt PII at application level before database storage
- Use separate encryption keys for different data types
- Implement proper key rotation

**Audit & Monitoring:**
- Log all signature creation/verification attempts
- Implement anomaly detection
- Regular security audits of signature usage

**Alternative Architecture Suggestion:**
Instead of storing government IDs directly, consider:
1. User provides ID for initial verification
2. System generates a unique cryptographic keypair
3. Store only the public key and a salted hash of ID
4. Digital signatures are created using the private key
5. Verification uses the stored public key

This approach provides non-repudiation while protecting sensitive data.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss specific implementation strategies for the security measures?

To build a digital signature system with the requirements you’ve outlined—using Rust, Axum for the server, and PostgreSQL for the database—I’ll guide you step-by-step on how to approach this conceptually. I’ll also explain how to read Rust crate documentation effectively to support your project, highlight security considerations, and point out potential flaws in the system design. Since you’ve asked not to provide code, this will focus on the process and key decisions you’ll need to make, empowering you to implement it yourself.

### How to Read Rust Crate Documentation

Rust crate documentation is your primary resource for understanding how to use libraries like Axum, SQLx (for PostgreSQL), and others. Here’s how to approach it effectively for your digital signature tool:

1. **Locate the Documentation**:
   - Visit **crates.io** and search for the crate (e.g., `axum`, `sqlx`, `bcrypt`).
   - Click the crate name to go to its page, then find the **Documentation** link (usually points to **docs.rs**).
   - Alternatively, go directly to `https://docs.rs/<crate-name>` (e.g., `https://docs.rs/axum`).

2. **Understand the Structure**:
   - **Overview**: Start with the top section, which explains what the crate does. For Axum, it’ll describe how it’s a web framework built on async Rust.
   - **Modules**: Look for sections listing modules (e.g., `axum::routing`, `axum::handler`). These contain the tools you’ll use.
   - **Examples**: Scroll to find code examples. For instance, Axum’s docs include examples of setting up routes and handling requests—perfect for your server endpoints.
   - **Structs and Traits**: Check key types like `axum::Router` or `sqlx::PgPool` to understand how to configure them.

3. **Search for Specific Needs**:
   - For your project:
     - **Axum**: Look up how to create async HTTP endpoints (e.g., `POST /register`, `POST /login`) and middleware for authentication.
     - **SQLx**: Search for async PostgreSQL queries (e.g., `query_as!`) and connection pooling.
     - **Cryptography**: For digital signatures, find a crate like `ring` or `sha2` and read how to generate secure hashes.
   - Use Ctrl+F to search keywords like “async”, “middleware”, or “hash”.

4. **Follow Examples**:
   - Copy and adapt examples from the docs. For instance, Axum’s routing example can be modified for your registration endpoint.

5. **Explore Dependencies**:
   - Check the crate’s `Cargo.toml` on GitHub (linked from crates.io) to see recommended companion crates (e.g., `tower` for Axum).

6. **Community Help**:
   - If stuck, search the Rust Discord or forums (linked from rust-lang.org) with specific questions like “How to use SQLx with Axum for async queries?”

Start with Axum and SQLx docs, as they’re central to your server and database. For security (e.g., hashing, 2FA), explore crates like `bcrypt` and `totp-rs` later.

### Building the Digital Signature System

Here’s how to design and implement your system based on your requirements:

#### 1. Core Requirements
- **User Input**: Users provide a government-approved ID (fingerprint, passport, Aadhaar) and create an account with a unique username, email, and password.
- **Digital Signature**: Each user gets one immutable digital signature, stored on a centralized server. It persists even if the account is deleted.
- **Uniqueness**: The server checks the signature’s hash for uniqueness to avoid collisions.
- **Account Management**: Users can change email/password, recover accounts, and use 2FA.
- **Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL (database), Axum (server), async operations, and sanitization.

#### 2. Database Design (PostgreSQL)
- **Users Table**:
  - `user_id` (primary key, auto-increment)
  - `username` (unique, indexed)
  - `email` (unique, indexed)
  - `password_hash` (hashed with bcrypt)
  - `unique_id` (government ID, validated)
  - `digital_signature_id` (foreign key, nullable if account is deleted)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at`

- **Digital Signatures Table**:
  - `signature_id` (primary key)
  - `hash` (unique, indexed)
  - `created_at`

- **Notes**:
  - Separate signatures from users to keep them persistent after account deletion.
  - Index `username`, `email`, and `hash` for fast lookups.

#### 3. Server Design (Axum)
- **Endpoints**:
  - **POST `/register`**: Validate unique ID, create user, generate signature.
  - **POST `/login`**: Authenticate with username/email, password, and 2FA.
  - **POST `/forgot-password`**: Send reset link to email.
  - **POST `/recover-email`**: Use username and signature to send recovery token.
  - **PATCH `/update-profile`**: Update email/password.

- **Async Operations**:
  - Use SQLx for non-blocking database queries.
  - Handle email sending asynchronously.

#### 4. Digital Signature Creation
- **Steps**:
  - On registration, generate a hash using the unique ID, timestamp, and a random salt.
  - Use a secure hash function (e.g., SHA-256 from the `sha2` crate).
  - Query the `digital_signatures` table to check if the hash exists.
  - If unique, store it and link to the user.
- **Uniqueness**: Add a random component or use a UUID if collisions are a concern.

#### 5. Security Measures (SSDLC)
- **Authentication**: Use JWT or sessions; add 2FA with an authenticator app (e.g., TOTP).
- **Password**: Hash with bcrypt; reset via email with a time-limited token.
- **Input Sanitization**: Use prepared statements (SQLx) to prevent SQL injection.
- **HTTPS**: Encrypt all traffic.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limit login attempts to stop brute-force attacks.
- **Database**: Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., unique_id); restrict access.
- **Monitoring**: Log security events for auditing.

#### 6. Account Management
- **Updates**: Allow email/password changes without affecting the signature.
- **Forgot Password**: Email a reset link.
- **Email Recovery**:
  - User provides username and signature.
  - Send a token to the email, partially display it (e.g., `exa****@gmail.com`) in the UI for confirmation.
- **Deletion**: Remove user data but keep the signature in the `digital_signatures` table.

### Security Vulnerabilities and Flaws

1. **Centralized Server**:
   - A single server is a point of failure. Consider redundancy or blockchain for resilience.
2. **Hash-Based Signatures**:
   - Hashes alone aren’t true digital signatures. Use cryptographic signatures (e.g., RSA, ECDSA) for authenticity.
3. **Unique ID Forgery**:
   - Validate government IDs thoroughly; weak checks could allow duplicates.
4. **Immutable Signatures**:
   - Ensure the generation process is tamper-proof.
5. **Email Risks**:
   - Spoofing or interception could compromise recovery. Use secure email protocols.
6. **Collision Risk**:
   - SHA-256 is collision-resistant but not perfect. Add randomness to reduce risks.

---

### Next Steps

1. **Start Small**: Set up an Axum server with a basic `/register` endpoint and PostgreSQL connection using SQLx.
2. **Iterate**: Add features like signature generation, login, and 2FA one by one.
3. **Test**: Simulate attacks (e.g., SQL injection, brute-force) and edge cases (e.g., duplicate IDs).
4. **Learn**: Dive into the docs for Axum, SQLx, and a crypto crate as you go.

This approach ensures a secure, functional system while letting you explore Rust’s ecosystem hands-on. Good luck!

Okay, this is an ambitious project with significant security implications! I'll guide you on how to approach this, focusing on reading Rust crate documentation and highlighting key design considerations and potential vulnerabilities.

### How to Read Rust Crate Documentation

Rust's documentation system is excellent. Here's how to navigate it:

1.  **crates.io:** This is the official Rust community's package registry. When you want to find a crate, you'll typically search here first.
    * **Search Bar:** Type the name of the crate (e.g., `tokio`, `axum`, `argon2`).
    * **Crate Page:** Once you find a crate, its page on `crates.io` will provide:
        * A brief description.
        * Links to its repository (usually GitHub).
        * The **"Documentation" link:** This is your primary target. It will take you to `docs.rs`.
        * `Cargo.toml` entry: How to add it to your project.
        * Statistics, license, etc.

2.  **docs.rs:** This is where the actual API documentation lives. Every public item (structs, enums, functions, traits, modules) in a crate is documented here.
    * **Table of Contents (Left Pane):** This lists all the modules within the crate. You can click on them to drill down.
    * **Search Bar (Top):** Crucial for finding specific items. If you know the name of a type or function you're looking for, type it here.
    * **Item Pages:** When you click on a module, struct, function, etc., you'll see:
        * **Description:** Explains what the item does.
        * **Examples:** Often, there are code examples demonstrating how to use the item. These are invaluable!
        * **Methods/Fields:** For structs, it lists their methods and fields.
        * **Trait Implementations:** Shows which traits the item implements (e.g., `Debug`, `Clone`, `Send`, `Sync`).
        * **Source Code Link:** Most `docs.rs` pages have a link to the actual source code on GitHub. This is incredibly useful for understanding how something works under the hood if the documentation isn't clear enough.
    * **Feature Flags:** Many crates use feature flags to enable optional functionality. Check the `Cargo.toml` example on `crates.io` or the crate's `docs.rs` page for available features. You'll specify these in your `Cargo.toml`.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **Need a web framework:** Search `crates.io` for "axum".
2.  Go to the `axum` page on `crates.io`, click the "Documentation" link.
3.  On `docs.rs/axum`, look at the `axum::Router` documentation for how to define routes.
4.  Need to handle JSON requests? Search for `Json` or `extractors`. You'll find `axum::Json`. Read its documentation.
5.  Want to connect to PostgreSQL? Search `crates.io` for "postgres" or "sqlx". Let's say you choose `sqlx`.
6.  Go to `docs.rs/sqlx`, read about `sqlx::PgPool`, how to run migrations, and execute queries.

### Your Digital Signature Tool: Design Guidance

Let's break down your requirements and provide guidance for each part.

#### Core Technologies

* **Rust:** The language you've chosen.
* **Axum:** Your web framework. Excellent choice for async.
* **SQLx:** The best async-first SQL toolkit for Rust. It supports PostgreSQL. Use its compile-time query checking feature for safety.
* **PostgreSQL:** Robust and reliable relational database.

#### Key Modules/Components You'll Need

1.  **Authentication Module:**
    * **User Registration:**
        * `POST /register` endpoint.
        * Collect email, password.
        * **Password Hashing:** **CRITICAL.** Use a strong, modern KDF (Key Derivation Function) like Argon2 or scrypt. **NEVER store plain passwords.** Rust crates like `argon2` or `scrypt` are available.
        * Store `username` (if distinct from email), `email`, `hashed_password`. Ensure `email` and `username` are unique with database constraints.
        * Email verification: Send a confirmation email with a unique token. The user must click this link to activate their account. This prevents using fake emails.
    * **User Login:**
        * `POST /login` endpoint.
        * Collect email/username and password.
        * Verify password using the same KDF.
        * **Session Management:** Once authenticated, create a session (e.g., using JWTs or server-side sessions). Axum has middleware for this or you can implement it yourself. Store the session token securely (e.g., in an `HttpOnly` cookie).
        * **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication):** For Authenticator apps (TOTP), you'll need a crate like `totp-rs` or `oathtool`. Users would scan a QR code to link their authenticator app.
    * **Forgot Password:**
        * `POST /forgot-password` endpoint: User provides email.
        * Generate a unique, time-limited password reset token. Store it in the database associated with the user.
        * Send an email with a link containing this token.
        * `POST /reset-password` endpoint: User provides new password and the token. Verify the token's validity and reset the password.
    * **Forgot Email/Username (Recovery):** This is trickier.
        * Your design states "recover using username with digital signature by sending a token to verify user to email". This implies the user *remembers their username* but not their email associated with it, or vice-versa.
        * If they only remember the username: You'd need to send a token to the *registered email* and show "partial chars in the email will show in UI". This implies storing some partial, non-identifiable part of the email. This is a usability feature but be careful not to reveal too much information.

2.  **Digital Signature Module:**
    * **Data Collection:**
        * `POST /create-signature` endpoint.
        * User provides **fingerprint, passport number, or Aadhar/Gov ID**. **BIG RED FLAG HERE: Storing this raw data on your server is extremely dangerous and almost certainly not compliant with GDPR, HIPAA, etc. You should NEVER store biometric data (fingerprints) or raw government IDs directly.**
        * **Alternative for ID verification:** Instead of storing the raw data, you should integrate with a **trusted third-party identity verification service (e.g., KYC provider)**. They handle the verification and give you a confirmation that the user's identity has been verified. You store only a unique identifier from that service, *not* the raw ID data.
        * For fingerprints: Users typically provide a *hash* of their fingerprint or a derived credential from it, not the raw biometric data. This is usually handled on the client-side with specialized hardware.
    * **Signature Generation:**
        * **Hash Input Data:** Combine relevant user data (perhaps a UUID for the user, and the *result* of the identity verification, not the raw ID itself). You need a strong, collision-resistant cryptographic hash function. SHA-256 or SHA-512 are standard. Rust's `sha2` crate is what you'd use.
        * **Uniqueness Check:** Before storing, query your PostgreSQL database to see if this hash already exists.
        * **Collision Avoidance:** If a hash collision *does* occur (highly unlikely with SHA-256 for random data, but possible if the input data space is small or predictable), your system **must not** create the signature. Instead, it should prompt the user or regenerate part of the input to ensure uniqueness. You might need to add a unique salt to the input data for hashing to make collisions even less likely, or append a counter.
        * **Storing the Signature:**
            * Store the *hash* of the data as the "digital signature" in your database.
            * Associate it with the `user_id`.
            * Add a timestamp of creation.
            * Crucially: "once the digital signature created and provided to the user, it can't change or alter at all." This means your database design for this table should reflect immutability.

3.  **Database Interaction Layer:**
    * Use `sqlx` to interact with PostgreSQL.
    * Define your database schema (tables for `users`, `digital_signatures`, `password_reset_tokens`, `email_verification_tokens`).
    * Use `sqlx::migrate!` for database migrations to manage schema changes version control.
    * Implement async database operations (`async fn`).
    * **Connection Pooling:** Use `sqlx::PgPool` for efficient database connections.

4.  **Server Protection & Sanitization:**
    * **Input Sanitization:** Axum extractors (like `Json`, `Form`, `Query`) automatically handle basic deserialization. For string inputs that go into SQL queries (though `sqlx` prepared statements protect against SQL injection), or are displayed to users, you might need to escape HTML characters (for XSS prevention). Consider crates like `ammonia` for HTML sanitization if you allow user-generated content that could contain HTML.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Protect against brute-force attacks on login, registration, and password reset. Use a crate like `governor` (though you'd need to integrate it with Axum manually or find an Axum-specific middleware).
    * **SSL/TLS:** Your Axum server MUST serve over HTTPS. This protects data in transit. You'll need to configure a reverse proxy like Nginx or Caddy to handle SSL termination. Rust has `rustls` or `native-tls` for TLS, but it's often easier to let a reverse proxy manage it.
    * **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** If your frontend is on a different domain, you'll need to configure CORS middleware in Axum.
    * **Security Headers:** Set appropriate HTTP security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`). The `tower-http` crate (often used with Axum) provides middleware for many of these.
    * **SSDLC (Secure Software Development Life Cycle):**
        * **Threat Modeling:** Before coding, identify potential threats (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, brute force, data breaches, DoS).
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow Rust's safety guidelines. Use `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt`.
        * **Code Review:** Get a second pair of eyes on your security-sensitive code.
        * **Automated Testing:** Unit, integration, and security tests (e.g., fuzzing, penetration testing).
        * **Vulnerability Management:** Plan for how to respond to discovered vulnerabilities.
        * **Least Privilege:** Your database user should only have the necessary permissions.
        * **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement robust logging for security events (failed logins, account changes, signature creation). Use a tool like `tracing` for structured logging.
        * **Regular Audits:** Periodically review your code and infrastructure.

#### Specific Requirements Breakdown

* **"one digital signature for one user."** This implies a `one-to-one` relationship between `users` and `digital_signatures` tables. Or, the digital signature table has a `user_id` column with a `UNIQUE` constraint on it.
* **"the signature are saved in one centralized server."** This is handled by your PostgreSQL database.
* **"hash collision should avoid creating a digital signature and it should be unique."** As discussed, implement a check before insertion. If a collision is detected (after sufficient salting/input variation), the operation should fail. Consider adding a unique constraint on the hash column in your database.
* **"user can change the password, email but once the digital signature created and provided to the user, it can't change or alter at all."** Ensure your database schema and API endpoints enforce this immutability for the digital signature record. No `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations on existing digital signatures.
* **"even the user deleted their account, the digital signature remain there in the server."** This is a critical design choice. If a user deletes their account, you would mark their `user` record as "inactive" or "deleted" rather than purging it, if you want to retain the link to the digital signature. Or, the digital signature record becomes orphaned but still exists in the `digital_signatures` table. You'll need a policy for what happens to the associated `user_id` in this scenario (e.g., nullify it or link to a generic "deleted user" entry).
* **"forgot password will send mail to reset the user password."** See Authentication Module.
* **"forget mail can recover using username with digital signature by sending a token to verify user to email and if user can click and recover the account, the partial char in the email will show in ui and tell to user that this the email so go and confirm now."** This sounds like a recovery path for when a user forgets their *email address* associated with their account but remembers their username. This is complex and carries risk.
    * **Risk:** If an attacker knows the username, they might be able to trick the system into revealing partial email addresses, aiding in phishing or further attacks.
    * **Mitigation:** The "digital signature" part here is confusing. Do you mean they provide something derived from their signature? Or that the signature itself is used to verify? If the user *has* their digital signature (which is just a hash), how does that help them recover their email if they don't know the email?
    * **Alternative:** Standard practice is to provide strong account recovery options based on pre-registered recovery emails/phone numbers, or security questions. Relying on "partial chars" of an email requires careful implementation to avoid information leakage.

### Potential Security Vulnerabilities and Flaws in Your Design

This is the most crucial part. Your current design has several **major security flaws and risks**:

1.  **Storing Raw Biometric Data (Fingerprints) and Government IDs:**
    * **Flaw:** This is a catastrophic privacy and security risk. If your server is breached, this highly sensitive, immutable PII is exposed. You cannot change a fingerprint if it's compromised.
    * **Mitigation:** **ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS.** Integrate with a trusted KYC (Know Your Customer) or identity verification service. They handle the sensitive data, and you get a token or confirmation that the user's identity was verified. For fingerprints, the user's device (e.g., phone with a biometric sensor) should generate a cryptographic proof or signed assertion based on the fingerprint, and *that* is what's sent to your server, not the raw fingerprint data.

2.  **Lack of Client-Side Signature Generation/Proof:**
    * **Flaw:** Your "digital signature" seems to be a hash generated *by the server* based on user input. This is not a true digital signature in the cryptographic sense (where a user uses a private key to sign data, and the server verifies with a public key). If your "digital signature" is just a hash of user-provided data, it doesn't prove the user *intended* to sign something or that they uniquely authorized it, beyond the initial identity verification.
    * **Mitigation:** If you intend a true digital signature, you need:
        * **Asymmetric Cryptography:** Users need a private key. This key should ideally never leave their device.
        * **Client-Side Signing:** The user's device uses their private key to sign a hash of the document/data.
        * **Server-Side Verification:** Your server verifies the signature using the user's *public key*.
        * This changes your architecture significantly, requiring client-side key management. For this, you'd look into WebAuthn (FIDO2) or other cryptographic signature libraries.

3.  **Ambiguity of "Digital Signature":**
    * **Flaw:** You're using "digital signature" to mean a unique hash associated with a user. This is *not* what a digital signature typically means in cryptography (which involves asymmetric key pairs for non-repudiation and integrity). If it's merely a unique ID derived from PII, then the name is misleading and the security properties are different.
    * **Mitigation:** Clarify your terminology. If it's just a unique identifier derived from user data, call it that. If you truly want cryptographic digital signatures, you need to implement asymmetric key management.

4.  **"Forgot Email" Recovery using "Digital Signature":**
    * **Flaw:** The description is vague and risky. If the "digital signature" is just a hash you store, how does a user provide it to recover an email? If they input the raw data (fingerprint, ID), that's back to Flaw #1. If it's a cryptographic signature, how do they sign if they can't access their account/email?
    * **Mitigation:** Re-evaluate this feature. Consider standard account recovery methods.

5.  **Username Uniqueness and Information Leakage:**
    * **Flaw:** If "username" is distinct from email and an attacker can enumerate usernames (e.g., through registration or "forgot username" attempts), it aids in targeting specific accounts. Showing "partial chars in email" also risks leaking information.
    * **Mitigation:** When an account is not found (e.g., for login or password reset), provide generic error messages ("Invalid credentials" or "If an account exists for this email, a reset link has been sent"). Be cautious about revealing if a username/email exists in "forgot password/email" flows.

6.  **Hash Collision Strategy:**
    * **Flaw:** While highly improbable with strong hashes like SHA-256 for random-enough inputs, simply "avoiding creation" isn't a robust long-term strategy if the input space for the hash is limited or predictable.
    * **Mitigation:** Ensure the input to your hash function includes sufficient entropy (e.g., a UUID generated for the user, plus a salt) to make collisions practically impossible. Also, enforce a `UNIQUE` constraint on the hash column in your PostgreSQL table to prevent accidental duplicates at the database level.

7.  **Data Retention (Digital Signature upon Account Deletion):**
    * **Flaw:** Retaining a "digital signature" even after account deletion, especially if it's derived from PII, can conflict with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR's "right to be forgotten").
    * **Mitigation:** Carefully review data retention policies and legal compliance. If the signature is truly immutable and crucial for historical record, you need a strong legal basis for retaining it, even after account deletion. Consider pseudonymization if possible.

8.  **Lack of CSRF Protection:**
    * **Flaw:** If you're using cookie-based sessions, without proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, an attacker could trick a logged-in user into performing unwanted actions.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement CSRF tokens in your frontend and verify them on the backend for all state-changing `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` requests. `tower-http` might offer middleware for this.

9.  **No Audit Logs for Signature Usage:**
    * **Flaw:** While you store the signature, you don't mention logging *when* it's accessed or provided to the user.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust audit logging for all critical operations, especially signature access/provision.

10. **Insufficient Error Handling/Disclosure:**
    * **Flaw:** If your API returns overly verbose error messages (e.g., database errors, stack traces), it can reveal internal system details to attackers.
    * **Mitigation:** Always return generic error messages to the client. Log detailed errors internally.

### Next Steps for You:

1.  **Refine "Digital Signature" Definition:** Clarify what you truly mean by "digital signature." Is it a cryptographic signature (requiring client-side key management) or just a unique, immutable identifier? This will fundamentally change your design.
2.  **Prioritize Security:** Seriously consider the implications of storing sensitive PII and biometrics. This is your biggest hurdle.
3.  **Familiarize Yourself with Crates:**
    * **Axum:** Start with basic routing, extractors (`Json`, `Form`), and state management.
    * **SQLx:** Learn about connection pools, migrations, and executing queries.
    * **Argon2/Scrypt:** How to hash and verify passwords.
    * **Sha2:** How to generate cryptographic hashes.
    * **Totp-rs:** For 2FA.
    * **Tower-http:** For middleware (CORS, security headers, etc.).
4.  **Database Schema Design:** Sketch out your `users`, `digital_signatures`, `tokens` tables.
5.  **Environment Variables:** Learn how to use `dotenv` or `envy` crate to load configuration securely (e.g., database URL, secret keys).
6.  **Start Small:** Begin with user registration and login, then move to the digital signature part.

Good luck! This is a challenging but rewarding project. Remember, security is paramount in such a system.
